        <p>To,</p>
        <p>The Principal,<br>XYZ</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Application for leave due to urgent piece of work</p>
        <p><strong>Respected Sir,</strong></p>
        <p>
            I hope this finds you in good health. I am Abdullah of class 11th C. 
            I am writing this application in order to request you grant me leave for two days 
            as I have some urgent piece of work to attend to at home. 
            As a result, I am required to be there at the earliest in order to help my family members 
            with the urgent piece of work. 
            I request you to grant me leave for the next two days, i.e., October 31st and November 1st 
            so that I can go back and wind up work at the earliest. 
            I will be in contact with my classmates regarding the assignments and curriculum 
            and will complete them once I am back.
        </p>
