    <p>An Electric Vehicle (EV) bike is a modern innovation in transportation that combines efficiency, eco-friendliness, and technology. Unlike traditional petrol bikes, EV bikes run on electric power stored in rechargeable batteries. These batteries usually take a few hours to charge and can provide a range of 60 to 150 kilometers, depending on the model and battery capacity. EV bikes have become increasingly popular in recent years due to rising fuel costs, environmental concerns, and the advancement of green technology. They are designed to produce zero emissions, which helps reduce air pollution and supports a cleaner environment.

One of the most attractive features of EV bikes is their low maintenance cost. Since they do not have engines with multiple moving parts like fuel bikes, they require less servicing. The cost of charging an EV bike is also much lower than refueling with petrol, making it economical for daily commuters. Additionally, EV bikes operate silently, reducing noise pollution in crowded cities. Many EV bikes also come equipped with smart features such as digital displays, GPS tracking, keyless start, and mobile app connectivity, which make the riding experience more convenient and enjoyable.

The lightweight design and smooth acceleration make EV bikes ideal for both short and medium-distance travel. Governments in many countries are promoting electric vehicles by offering subsidies, tax benefits, and installing public charging stations to encourage people to adopt clean transportation. This shift towards electric mobility not only helps reduce dependency on fossil fuels but also contributes to sustainable development.</p>""
